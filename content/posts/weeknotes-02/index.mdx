This week I'd like to note something we learnt as a team on my current delivery. We are working in a Scrum team, but I think some processes are redundant. I have a strong opinion on scoring tickets. Although it can start a valuable conversation about the problem we need to solve, the scores themselves are meaningless and no more than guesses. I believe estimates are unnecessary unless there is pressure from stakeholders, and you need a space where you can explain the complexity of a piece of work. I'd highly recommend watching [#NoEstimates by Allen Holub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVBlnCTu9Ms) if you'd like to hear more arguments against estimates. In the last few sprints we started shifting towards Kanban with changing priorities and sometimes over or underestimated tickets; we needed to deviate from our plans and move tickets into the sprint or carry over to the next sprint. So why not do [Scrumban?](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/scrumban/#:~:text=Scrumban%20is%20a%20project%20management,agile%2C%20efficient%2C%20and%20productive)

I've made some improvements on a React pet project, refactored class components into functional components and resolved a [nasty infinite loop](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-useeffect-infinite-loop/) caused by the `useEffect` hook. What a rookie mistake! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I've played a bit with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) because I'd like to build a personal website/blog so these weekly notes can find a home. üè°
