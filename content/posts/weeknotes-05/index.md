I have not written a single weeknote for a couple of weeks. I have finished 35% of the [Ultimate AWS Certified Developer Associate 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/) course on Udemy. That is over 10 hours of lectures and another 20 to go; pretty intense. I need more time!

## What did I learn?

[Loadbalancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/load-balancer-types.html), [Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/01/introducing-aws-auto-scaling/), [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/?aurora-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&aurora-whats-new.sort-order=desc), [ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/), [VPC fundamentals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html)(this section is a tough one!), loads of things about [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and a bit about [Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/).

I also learned that of the [AWS Python SDK (Boto3)](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/), named after the pink river dolphin, known as the boto, that lives in the Amazon river. Pretty cool, right? üê¨

I'm making notes using MarkDown on my GitHub account. It is a massive pile of an [AWS brain dump](https://github.com/C-gyorfi/AWS-knowledge-dump), but it may be helpful because someone forked it! Yay!

I've continued reading [The Science of Rapid Skill Acquisition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Science-Rapid-Skill-Acquisition-Information-ebook/dp/B07NS6QNSR) and I learned about the [Learning Pyramid](https://tofasakademi.com/the-learning-pyramid/):

![Learning Pyramid](https://tofasakademi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Learnin-Pyramid-740x642.png)

Although the accuracy of this theory is debatable, I realised that I need to diversify my studying methods. I use a vast amount of audio-visual material, and I'm concerned that what I learn won't stick with me for long. ü§Ø

Apart from this, I'm onboarding a new engineer, and I'm starting to realise how much knowledge I hold specific to the delivery. We may need to work on knowledge management. üíº
