I'm trying to improve my front-end knowledge. This week I continued the [Full React Course 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4) by freeCodeCamp. It turned out that having some experience with node.js and React exposure was enough for me to skip/fast forward the first 3-4 hours. Although, it introduced me to a cool VS code extention: [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com/), which displays runtime values in your editor next to your code, as you type, no more need for `console.log()` 🎉

Continuing with [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) here are some Big O notations of the operations of some of the common data structures:

|             | Hash tables(avarage) | Hash tables(worst) |Arrays      | Linked lists |
| ----------- | -------------------- |--------------------|------------|--------------|
| `Search`    | O(1)                 |O(n)                |O(1)        |O(n)          |
| `Insert`    | O(1)                 |O(n)                |O(n)        |O(1)          |
| `Delete`    | O(1)                 |O(n)                |O(n)        |O(1)          |

> *Where O(1) means it takes one step and O(n) means it takes as many steps as the number of elements in the data structure.
